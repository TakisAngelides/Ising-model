# Ising-model

Simulation of the Ising model in 2D and 3D with next-nearest neighbours interactions in the appropriate .py files. A lot of subjects are
investigated such as the heat capacity, grain clustering, susceptibility, hysteresis and others. The bootstrap method is also implemented
to calculate statistical errors on observables.
